# Public Transport Geographical Data Analysis

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing public transport-related geographical data, specifically for Victoria, Australia. The analysis uses datasets sourced from [MyGov Victoria](https://www.mygov.vic.gov.au/) and other reliable geographical data repositories. The goal is to understand how different localities, regions, and areas in Victoria are organized in terms of public services like transportation and delivery zones.

The data includes postcodes, localities, and geographical coordinates, as well as administrative details like SA3 regions, Local Government Areas (LGA), electorates, and public health networks. By performing exploratory data analysis, this project provides insights into how the Victorian public transport system interacts with different administrative boundaries.

## Dataset Sources

- **Victorian Geographical Data**: The primary dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [MyGov Victoria](https://www.mygov.vic.gov.au/), providing up-to-date information on localities, postcodes, and geographical classifications in Victoria.
- **Additional Sources**: Complementary data was also gathered from publicly available datasets, including:
  - [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](https://www.abs.gov.au/): Providing detailed breakdowns of Statistical Areas (SA3) for regional analysis.
  - [Data.Vic](https://data.vic.gov.au/): A repository for Victorian government datasets, which was used to cross-reference localities with transport and public service areas.

## Key Features

- **Geographical Data Processing**: The project begins by loading the Victorian dataset, containing information about localities, postcodes, states, and their corresponding geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude).
- **Administrative Area Classification**: The dataset is enriched with classifications such as:
  - **SA3 (Statistical Areas Level 3)**: A spatial unit used for regional analysis in Australia.
  - **LGA (Local Government Areas)**: A breakdown of Victoria into local government administrative areas.
  - **Electorates**: Political boundaries representing the areas for federal and state elections.
  - **Delivery Areas**: Zones defined for public services like postal deliveries and other municipal services.
- **Public Health Networks (PHN)**: The data includes a mapping of localities to public health regions, allowing analysis of healthcare service distribution across Victoria.
  
## Data Analysis Steps

1. **Data Importing**: The Victorian dataset is imported into the notebook and stored as a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
2. **Data Exploration**: Key columns, including postcode, locality, state, and geographical coordinates, are displayed and analyzed to understand the structure and consistency of the data.
3. **Geographical Categorization**: The data is categorized into different administrative and service zones, such as delivery areas, SA3 regions, LGAs, and electorates. This categorization provides a clear understanding of how public transport and other services are distributed across Victoria.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Initial statistical exploration is done on the geographical data to identify patterns and relationships between different regions and public services.
5. **Visualization (Optional)**: Future updates could include geographical plotting (using libraries like Matplotlib or Folium) to visualize these regions and their relationship to public transport infrastructure.
